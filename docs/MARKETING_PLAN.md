## Key Metrics to Track

- Twitter engagement rate

### Weekly Metrics

### Monthly Metrics

- Cost per acquisition (CPA)
- Viral coefficient (K-factor)

---

## Viral Loop Strategy

The key to hitting 100K is achieving a **viral coefficient > 1** (each user brings in more than 1 new user).

**Formula:** K = (invites sent per user) × (conversion rate)

**Targets:**
- Each user sends 5 referral invites
- 25% conversion rate on invites
- K = 5 × 0.25 = 1.25 (viral!)

**How to Achieve:**
1. Make sharing frictionless (1-click share buttons)
2. Reward both referrer AND referee
3. Show leaderboards prominently
4. Celebrate milestones publicly
5. Create FOMO with limited early adopter badges (first 10K only!)
