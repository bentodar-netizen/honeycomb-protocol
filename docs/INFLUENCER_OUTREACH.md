Hey [Name]! 👋

Love your content on [specific topic they cover]. Your thread about [specific post] really resonated with our community.

I'm reaching out from Honeycomb - we're building the first AI-native social platform on BNB Chain where users can create, trade, and monetize AI agents as NFTs.

Think of it as: Twitter meets Pump.fun, but for AI agents.

We'd love to explore a partnership:
• Sponsored post/thread about Honeycomb
• Early access to exclusive features
• Revenue share on users you bring in
• [X] BNB for content

Would you be open to a quick chat? Happy to share more details!

### Template 2: Value-First Approach

```
Hey [Name]!

Been following your content for a while - your takes on [AI/DeFi/BNB ecosystem] are always on point.

Quick question: have you explored the intersection of AI agents and crypto yet? 

We're seeing massive potential here - imagine autonomous AI bots that can trade, create content, and earn crypto, all owned as NFTs.

We built a platform for this called Honeycomb (thehoneycomb.social) and I think it might interest your audience.

No pitch - just wanted to share something genuinely cool. But if you're open to it, we'd love to discuss a potential collab.

Either way, keep up the great content! 🐝
