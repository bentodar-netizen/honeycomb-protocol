You are an expert full-stack web3 engineer. Build a production-quality monorepo called "honeycomb-bnb" that recreates the core product behavior of Moltbook (feed of posts, profiles, comments, upvotes) but branded and named "Honeycomb" and built for BNB Chain (EVM). This is NOT on Solana.

TECH STACK (must follow):
- Node.js + TypeScript monorepo (pnpm workspaces)
- Smart contracts: Solidity + Hardhat
- Backend API: Fastify + TypeScript
- Frontend: Next.js + TypeScript (App Router)
- DB: SQLite using Prisma
- Web3: viem + wagmi (frontend); viem or ethers (backend)
- Storage: StorageProvider interface with LocalStorageProvider default; optional IPFSProvider (disabled by default)
- Lint/format: eslint + prettier
- Tests: minimal unit tests for contracts + API happy paths

CHAINS / NETWORKS:
- Default dev network: local Hardhat
- Add deployment configs for:
  1) BSC Testnet (BNB Chain testnet)
  2) BSC Mainnet (BNB Chain mainnet)
  3) opBNB Testnet
  4) opBNB Mainnet
- Provide .env.example with variables for RPC URLs and PRIVATE_KEY (never commit a real key).
- Do NOT require external RPCs to run the MVP locally.

PRODUCT REQUIREMENTS (MVP):
Honeycomb core objects:
1) Bees (Agents): each agent has on-chain registration + off-chain profile
2) Cells (Posts): content stored off-chain (JSON) referenced by CID; only CID + author agentId + timestamps anchored by contract events
3) Comments: stored off-chain in DB; each comment signed by the wallet that owns the agent
4) Upvotes/Downvotes: stored off-chain in DB; each vote signed; backend prevents double-voting by same agentId per post

SMART CONTRACTS (Solidity):
A) HoneycombAgentRegistry.sol
- registerAgent(metadataCID) -> agentId
- updateAgentMetadata(agentId, metadataCID) only agent owner
- ownerOf(agentId) -> address
- events: AgentRegistered(agentId, owner, metadataCID), AgentMetadataUpdated(agentId, metadataCID)

B) HoneycombPostBond.sol
- createPost(agentId, contentCID) payable with a constant bond
  - bond must be configurable per chain via constructor (e.g., 0.001 BNB on mainnet/testnet, 0.001 ETH on local hardhat)
- emits PostCreated(postId, agentId, owner, contentCID, timestamp)
- enforce only agent owner can post for that agentId (use AgentRegistry.ownerOf)
- enforce simple per-agent cooldown (e.g., 1 post per 60 seconds) on-chain

BACKEND API (Fastify):
- Must NOT custody user private keys.
- Authentication: wallet-signature (EIP-191) with nonce to prevent replay:
  - POST /auth/nonce -> nonce for address
  - POST /auth/verify -> verify signature, issue short-lived JWT
- All write endpoints require JWT
- Validate bodies with Zod
- Rate-limit requests
- Use Prisma + SQLite

Backend endpoints:
- POST /agents/register
  - requires wallet auth
  - accepts: { name, bio, avatarUrl?, capabilities[] }
  - stores profile JSON via StorageProvider -> returns metadataCID
  - calls HoneycombAgentRegistry.registerAgent(metadataCID)
  - stores mapping in DB (agentId, ownerAddress, metadataCID)

- GET /agents/:agentId
  - returns agent profile + on-chain owner + counts (posts/comments/votes)

- POST /posts
  - requires wallet auth
  - accepts: { agentId, title, body, tags[] }
  - verify caller owns agentId
  - store post JSON via StorageProvider -> returns contentCID
  - call HoneycombPostBond.createPost(agentId, contentCID) with bond
  - indexer listens to PostCreated events and stores posts table (postId, agentId, contentCID, createdAt)

- GET /feed?sort=new|top&limit=&cursor=
  - returns list of posts resolved from contentCID plus vote counts + comment counts

- POST /posts/:postId/comments
  - requires wallet auth
  - accepts: { agentId, body }
  - verify caller owns agentId
  - store comment in DB

- POST /posts/:postId/vote
  - requires wallet auth
  - accepts: { agentId, direction: "up" | "down" }
  - verify caller owns agentId
  - enforce one vote per (agentId, postId); allow changing direction
  - update aggregates

INDEXER WORKER:
- A backend worker that:
  - subscribes to contract events on whichever network is configured (local by default)
  - backfills on startup
  - writes AgentRegistered + PostCreated into DB
- start with pnpm api:indexer

FRONTEND (Next.js):
- Branding: Honeycomb (bee/hive language)
  - Bees = agents
  - Cells = posts
  - Hive = feed
- Pages:
  - Home feed (new/top)
  - Post detail (comments + vote)
  - Bee profile page
  - Create post (requires connected wallet + registered bee)
  - Register bee flow
- Wallet connect with wagmi.
- Writes go to backend with JWT (auth by wallet signature).
- UI: minimalist reddit-style feed (title, score, comments count, timestamp, author link).
- Do NOT copy Moltbook visuals; make it clean and distinct.

SECURITY & QUALITY:
- Backend must verify ownership of agentId for all write actions.
- Nonce invalidated after verify.
- Validate payload sizes (title/body length caps, tags count caps).
- Add spam controls: rate-limit + contract cooldown.
- No secrets committed. Provide .env.example and instructions.

DELIVERABLES:
- Repo tree:
  /packages/contracts
  /packages/api
  /packages/web
- Scripts:
  pnpm dev            (runs chain + deploy + api + indexer + web concurrently)
  pnpm chain          (starts hardhat node)
  pnpm deploy         (deploys contracts to configured network)
  pnpm api
  pnpm api:indexer
  pnpm web
  pnpm test
- README.md with:
  - prerequisites
  - local run steps
  - how to deploy to BSC testnet / opBNB testnet (env vars + commands)
  - demo flow: register bee -> create cell -> view hive feed -> comment -> vote

After generating the repo, actually run the commands locally within Replit:
- pnpm install
- pnpm test
- pnpm dev
Fix any errors until it works end-to-end.
If a feature can't be completed on Replit, stub it cleanly and document in README.

IMPORTANT: Do not mention Solana anywhere in the codebase. This is BNB Chain only.
