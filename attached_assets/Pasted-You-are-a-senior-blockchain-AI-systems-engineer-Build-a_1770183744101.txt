You are a senior blockchain + AI systems engineer.

Build an AI-native autonomous launchpad called “Honeycomb Launcher” on BNB Chain.

CORE IDEA
AI agents (not humans) can autonomously:
- Create tokens
- Define launch parameters
- Launch via bonding curve
- Trigger graduation to PancakeSwap
- Operate without human signatures or manual actions

Humans only observe, trade, or fund agents.

CHAIN
- BNB Chain ONLY
- Native BNB for all bonding curve trades

TECH STACK
- Smart Contracts: Solidity (Hardhat)
- Backend Orchestrator: Node.js (TypeScript)
- AI Agent Runtime: Agent executes actions via delegated signer
- Web3: ethers v6
- Frontend: Next.js + Tailwind
- DB: SQLite (Prisma)
- Indexing: Contract event listeners

---

## 1️⃣ AI AGENT IDENTITY MODEL

Each AI agent has:
- agentId (UUID)
- controller contract wallet (EOA or AA-compatible)
- metadata (name, description, strategy, avatar)
- permissions:
  - canDeployToken
  - canLaunch
  - canGraduate

AI agents sign transactions using:
- Pre-authorized agent private key
- OR smart-contract based execution (preferred)

NO HUMAN SIGNATURES REQUIRED AFTER REGISTRATION.

---

## 2️⃣ AGENT TOKEN CREATION

AI agent can call:
launchToken(params)

Params:
- name
- symbol
- totalSupply (fixed)
- graduationTargetBNB
- curveParams
- agentNarrative (stored on-chain or IPFS)
- optional: autoLiquidityPercent (default 80%)

Flow:
1) Agent deploys ERC20 via factory
2) Supply minted directly into BondingCurveVault
3) Token is locked from external trading
4) Token enters “INCUBATING” state

Emit:
AgentTokenCreated(agentId, token, timestamp)

---

## 3️⃣ BONDING CURVE (AI-CONTROLLED MARKET)

Use *inventory-based CPMM bonding curve*:

- Vault holds:
  - tokenReserve
  - bnbReserve
- price = bnbReserve / tokenReserve

Rules:
- Anyone (human or agent) can buy/sell during incubation
- Platform fee: configurable (e.g. 1%) → Honeycomb treasury
- Slippage protection mandatory
- Curve math fully on-chain
- No DEX interaction yet

Emit:
Buy(user, bnbIn, tokensOut)
Sell(user, tokensIn, bnbOut)

---

## 4️⃣ AUTONOMOUS GRADUATION (NO BUTTONS)

Graduation is *automatic*.

Trigger condition:
- bnbReserve >= graduationTargetBNB

When condition is met:
- Contract auto-flags “READY_TO_GRADUATE”

AI agent (or permissionless keeper) executes:
graduate(token)

Execution:
1) Stop bonding curve trades
2) Convert BNB → WBNB
3) Create PancakeSwap pair
4) Add liquidity:
   - X% BNB + matching tokens
5) Lock LP tokens:
   - Timelock contract
6) Emit finalization events

Emit:
AgentGraduated(agentId, token, pair)

NO HUMAN APPROVALS  
NO ADMIN OVERRIDES

---

## 5️⃣ AI-TO-AI ECONOMICS (IMPORTANT)

AI agents can:
- Launch multiple tokens
- Buy/sell other agent tokens
- Compete for volume, holders, graduation speed

Optional extensions (prepare hooks):
- Agent reputation score
- Agent PnL tracking
- Agent leaderboard
- Agent vs Agent launch battles

---

## 6️⃣ SECURITY & CONSTRAINTS

- Agent cannot:
  - Withdraw LP
  - Change supply
  - Change graduation target after launch
- All parameters immutable post-creation
- Reentrancy protection
- One-time graduation enforced
- Emergency pause (DAO/multisig placeholder)

---

## 7️⃣ FRONTEND (OBSERVATION-FIRST)

UI is NOT for launching.

Pages:
- Agent Directory
- Agent Profile (strategy, launches, win rate)
- Token Page:
  - bonding curve chart
  - graduation progress
  - agent narrative
- “Graduated” badge + PancakeSwap link

Humans:
- connect wallet
- trade
- watch agents compete

---

## 8️⃣ CONFIG

.env
- BNB_RPC
- CHAIN_ID
- AGENT_EXECUTOR_KEY
- HONEYCOMB_TREASURY
- PLATFORM_FEE_BPS
- PANCAKESWAP_ROUTER
- WBNB_ADDRESS
- LP_LOCK_TIME

---

## 9️⃣ DELIVERABLES

/contract
- AgentRegistry
- TokenFactory
- BondingCurveVault
- GraduationExecutor
- LPLocker

/backend
- Agent runtime
- Event indexer
- AI execution loop

/frontend
- Agent & token explorer
- Live bonding curve UI

README
- How agents are registered
- How autonomous launches work
- How graduation happens
- Why humans are optional

IMPORTANT
This is NOT a normal launchpad.
This is a protocol where AI agents spawn assets and compete on BNB Chain.
Write the code clean, commented, deterministic, and production-minded.
